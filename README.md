# Keras-Tuner

Deep Learning Hyperparameter Optimization with Keras Tuner

Project Overview

This project uses Keras Tuner to optimize the hyperparameters of a deep learning model. The model is designed to solve a specific problem (e.g., classification, regression) and its performance is evaluated based on its accuracy, loss, or other metrics. The goal is to search for the best combination of hyperparameters such as the number of layers, neurons, activation functions, and learning rates to improve model performance.

Dependencies

This project requires the following libraries:
	•	Python (version >= 3.6)
	•	TensorFlow (version >= 2.0)
	•	Keras Tuner
	•	NumPy
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Pandas
	•	Seaborn

Install the dependencies using pip:

pip install tensorflow keras-tuner numpy matplotlib pandas seaborn

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name


	2.	Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage

	1.	Ensure you have all the dependencies installed and your dataset is correctly formatted.
	2.	Run the script hyperparameter_optimization.py to start the hyperparameter tuning process.

python hyperparameter_optimization.py


	3.	The script will use Keras Tuner to search for the best hyperparameters, evaluate model performance, and output the results.

Model Architecture

This project uses a Keras Sequential model with fully connected layers (Dense) and activation functions that can be tuned. The architecture can be modified in the script, with the number of layers, neurons per layer, and activation functions being explored during hyperparameter tuning.

Example architecture:

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(units=hp.Int('units_1', min_value=64, max_value=512, step=64),
                activation=hp.Choice('activation_1', values=['relu', 'tanh', 'sigmoid'])))
model.add(Dense(units=hp.Int('units_2', min_value=64, max_value=512, step=64),
                activation=hp.Choice('activation_2', values=['relu', 'tanh', 'sigmoid'])))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

Hyperparameter Search Space

The hyperparameter search space defined in the code includes:
	•	Units: Number of neurons in each dense layer, ranging from 64 to 512.
	•	Activation Function: The activation function for each dense layer, options include ReLU, Tanh, and Sigmoid.
	•	Learning Rate: The learning rate for the optimizer, ranging from 0.001 to 0.01.
	•	Dropout Rate: The dropout rate for regularization, between 0 and 0.5.

Results

Once the Keras Tuner completes the hyperparameter search, the results will include the best combination of hyperparameters and the associated performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss).

Example output:

Best Hyperparameters:
Units Layer 1: 128
Activation Layer 1: ReLU
Units Layer 2: 256
Activation Layer 2: Sigmoid
Learning Rate: 0.001
Dropout Rate: 0.3

Best Model Performance:
Validation Accuracy: 94%
Validation Loss: 0.25

Troubleshooting

	•	NaN Loss or Accuracy: If you encounter NaN values during training, consider the following adjustments:
	•	Reduce the learning rate.
	•	Ensure the data is properly scaled and free from NaN values.
	•	Experiment with different initializers for weights.
	•	Slow Training: Hyperparameter tuning can be computationally expensive. Consider using early stopping or reducing the search space.
